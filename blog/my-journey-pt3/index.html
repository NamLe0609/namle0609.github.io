    This is part three of my 3-part article going through my journey, and how I got to where I am at now. If you have read neither, check them out here: <a href="/blog/my-journey-pt1">Part 1</a>, <a href="/blog/my-journey-pt2">Part 2</a>

    In the summer of this year, I interned at a Vietnamese company as a web dev intern and while the work was fun, I got to learn an entire webstack with tools I have never even seen before, I found that it wasnâ€™t something I really enjoyed. More specifically, I did not mind doing backed and the infrastructure, but anything involved with frontend was hell for me (I know that as much as I <s>hate</s> <s>despise</s> dislike this aspect of coding, I still needed to know it as everyone everywhere needs webdevs).
   </p>
   <p>
    The next school year was yet another eye-opening experience for me. The first few months was applying for interns (if you are reading this, please consider me for a position ðŸ˜Ž), which lead to some development but ultimately didnâ€™t result in much of anything. After doing another hackathon with my friends (this time doing a much more sophisticated project), I started my rounds of coursework, and this was perhaps the most stressful but fun moment of my career (?) (not really sure if this is the right word, but Iâ€™ll go with it anyway). Doing 5 project back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back, as well as worrying about studies basically drained me of all energy and time (look at my GitHub activity recently and that should be sufficient proof).
   </p>
   <p>
    All of which brings us to today, where I decided to make a website to aid my search for internships after completely finishing all these courseworks. If you read this far, you must be <em>reallyyyy</em> interested in my life story, which means you probably are interested in recruiting me (please I want an internship). If you arenâ€™t an employer and instead a poor soul that spent the last 5 minutes reading my backstory, then you probably are a weirdo (I do appreciate the fact that you are taking your time reading these posts though!).
   </p>
   <p>
    Anyway, thatâ€™s about all I have to say. Please continue to support me in the future! Bye bye!
